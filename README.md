# Marketing Lab Web Application

This project aims to create a Marketing Lab web application where users can simulate marketing campaigns for their products or services. The application will allow users to define their product, target audience, advertising strategies, and then monitor simulated real-time factors to predict Return on Investment (ROI).

## Features (Planned)

1.  **Product Definition:** Describe product type (service, software, website, hardware) and subcategories.
2.  **Targeting:** Specify target location and competitor details.
3.  **Advertisement Configuration:**
    *   Select media types (Print, Broadcast, Digital, etc.).
    *   Choose advertising approaches (Informative, Persuasive, etc.).
    *   Define payment models for digital ads (PPC, CPM, etc.).
    *   Input specific parameters for ad types (e.g., YouTuber details, newspaper ad costs).
4.  **Real-time Simulation & Monitoring:**
    *   Display chosen ad parameters and costs.
    *   Continuously monitor and display impact factors (cultural trends, competitor influence, etc.).
5.  **ROI Analysis:**
    *   Calculate and display predicted ROI.
    *   Provide reasons for potential losses.
    *   Suggest alternative strategies to improve ROI.

## Tech Stack (Initial)

*   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   Backend: (To be decided - potentially Python/Flask or Node.js/Express for simulation logic)

## How to Run

1.  Open `index.html` in a web browser.
